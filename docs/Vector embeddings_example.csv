"results of clinical data -based software validation for the subject device  demonstrated equivalent performance in comparison to the reference device.     The performance testing for ML -based rib segmentation algorithm was performed on 60 subjects (data sho wn in Table 8 -2)  during the product development.      Acceptance Criteria   The validation type and acceptance criteria is shown in the Table 8 -1 below:   Table 8 -1.

A threshold based interactive tool is used  to generate initial rib mask, then annotators will refine the rib mask. After the first round annotation, they will check each other’s  annotation.

You may, therefore , market the device, subject to the general controls  provisions of the Act. Although this letter refers to your product as a device, please be aware that some  cleared products may instead be combination products. The 510(k) Premarket Notification Database  available at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm  identifies combination  product submissions. The general controls provisions of the Act include re quirements for annual registration,  listing of devices, good manufacturing practice, labeling, and prohibitions against misbranding and  adulteration. Please note:  CDRH does not evaluate information related to contract liability warranties. We  remind you, however, that device labeling must be truthful and not misleading.   If your device is classified (see above) into either class II (Special Controls) or class III (PMA), it may

HipCheck provides static localization information derived from image processing of intra-operatively acquired static fluoroscopic images, by superposition of virtual measurement tools onto those X-ray images for skeletally mature patients.   HipMap FAI Analysis is a patient-specific report used to support surgeon or radiologist pre-operative clinical decision making. HipMap femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) Analysis provides a morphological analysis of a skeletally mature hip with potential FAI, including measurements and visualizations that describe hip impingement and stability.

HipMap provides three-dimensional analyses, 3D surface reconstructions, and annotated images to support surgeons with pre-operative clinical decision-making. V.INTENDED USE/INDICATIONS FOR USE STATEMENTHipCheck assists the surgeon to determine quantitative measurements forfemoroacetabular impingement (FAI) procedures. HipCheck provides static localizationinformation derived from image processing of intra -operatively acquired static fluoroscopic images, by superposition of virtual measurement tools onto those X -ray images for skeletally mature patients.HipMap FAI Analysis is a patient-specific report used to support surgeon or radiologist pre - operative clinical decision making.

"HipCheck  [K230045] Predicate  Device   HipCheck  [K182359]  Intended  Use/Indications for Use StatementHipCheck assists the surgeon to  determine quantitative measurements for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) procedures. HipCheck provides static localization information derived from image processing of intra-operatively acquired static fluoroscopic images, by superposition of virtual measurement tools onto those X-ray images for skeletally mature patients.   HipMap FAI Analysis is a patient-specific report used to support surgeon or radiologist pre-operative clinical decision making. HipMap femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) Analysis provides a morphological  analysis of a skeletally mature hip with HipCheck assists the surgeon to  determine quantitative measurements during femoroacetabular impingement procedures.  HipCheck provides static localization information derived from image processing of intra-operatively acquired X-ray images, by superposition of virtualmeasurement tools onto those X-rayimages.stryker    510(k) Summary  HipCheck 007 - 3  Traditional 510(k) Premarket Notification  potential FAI, including measurements  and visualizations that describe hip impingement and stability.

"contains three primary changes which are the subject of this 510(k). The first is a connectivity feature (Wireless and Ethernet)  on the HipCheck tablet which allows for the secure importation and exportation of case data. The second is the change in operating system the HipCheck software runs on; HipCheck 1.5.6 utilizes the Windows 10 operating system whereas the predicate utilizes Windows 8 . The third change is the inclusion of HipMap FAI Analysis.   Both the subject device and the predicate device share the core functionality to achieve visualization of the placement of virtual measurement tools for the determination of alpha angle. Updating to HipCheck version 1.5.6’s Alpha Angle algorithm has been done to enhance capabilities of the algorithm on uncommon image types (i.e., corner cases) while maintaining consistent capabilities on other image types.   In addition to these changes, bug fixes, administrator tool updates, new troubleshooting features, and graphical user interface updates were implemented with the upgrade to HipCheck version 1.5.6. Differences between the subject device and predicate device’s intended use, indications for use, and technological characteristics were evaluated through performance testing.  VII. PERFORMANCE DATA/NON-CLINICAL TESTING  Design verification testing was performed on HipCheck due to the risk analysis and product requirements. Testing included software and bench verification testing , as well as design validation. Design validation testing was conducted in a simulated -use environment by surgeon and sales representative users. Users were successfully able to use the HipCheck as intended to determine the alpha angle and utilize the virtual measurement and visualization tools.   Software testing  Software testing was conducted, and documentation provided, as recommended by FDA Guidance for Industry and Staff – Content of Premarket Submissions for Device Software Functions (June 2023). The software for this device
